I am a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in the [Machine Learning and Optimization team](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) (led by [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/)), where I am working on topics in generative modeling, large-scale ML, and retrieval.  
I graduated from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2023 with a bachelor's degree (with honours) in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/) and by [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/).  
My current research interests lie broadly in machine learning. I am particularly interested in generative modeling, optimization, sampling, large-scale ML, and other related topics.
