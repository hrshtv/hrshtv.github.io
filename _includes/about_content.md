I am a Founding ML/Research Engineer at [Inception](https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/), working on diffusion language models with [Prof. Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/), [Prof. Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/), and [Prof. Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/). Previously, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) in the [Machine Learning and Optimization team](https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/) (led by [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.prateekjain.org/)), where I worked on topics in generative modeling, large-scale ML, and retrieval.  
Prior to that, I graduated from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2023 with a bachelor's degree (with honours) in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/) and by [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/).  
My current research interests lie broadly in machine learning. I am particularly interested in generative modeling, RL for LLMs, optimization, sampling, large-scale ML, and other related topics.
